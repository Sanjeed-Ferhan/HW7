		<article >
			
			<p><b>Ramadan</b> is the ninth month of the Islamic calendar,observed by Muslims worldwide as a month of fasting (sawm), prayer, reflection and community.A commemoration of Muhammad's first revelation,[citation needed] the annual observance of Ramadan is regarded as one of the Five Pillars of Islam and lasts twenty-nine to thirty days, from one sighting of the crescent moon to the next.</p>
		</article>
		<article>
			<p>Fasting from sunrise to sunset is fard (obligatory) for all adult Muslims who are not acutely or chronically ill, travelling, elderly, pregnant, breastfeeding, diabetic, or menstruating.The predawn meal is referred to as suhur, and the nightly feast that breaks the fast is called iftar.Although fatwas have been issued declaring that Muslims who live in regions with a midnight sun or polar night should follow the timetable of Mecca,it is common practice to follow the timetable of the closest country in which night can be distinguished from day.</p>
		</article>
		<article>The spiritual rewards (thawab) of fasting are believed to be multiplied during Ramadan.Accordingly, Muslims refrain not only from <strong>food and drink</strong>, but also <strong>tobacco products, sexual relations, and sinful behavior</strong>,devoting themselves instead to salat (prayer), recitation of the Quran,and the performance of charitable deeds[citation needed] as they strive for purity and heightened awareness of Allah (taqwa).</article>

		<h1 style="text-align: center;"><u>Hadith of Ramadan</u></h1>
		<ol style="font-family: sans-serif;">
			<li>Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said:<q><b>When Ramadan enters, the gates of Paradise are opened, the gates of Hellfire are closed and the devils are chained. (Al-Bukhari and Muslim)</b></q></li>
			<li>Abu Hurayrah reported that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said:<q><b>Every action a son of Adam does shall be multiplied—a good action by ten times its value, up to 700 times. Allah says: With the exception of fasting, which belongs to Me, and I reward it accordingly. For, one abandons his desire and food for My sake. <br>
			There are two occasions of joy for a fasting person: one when he breaks his fast, and the other when he meets his Lord, and the (bad) breath (of a fasting person) is better in the sight of Allah than the fragrance of musk. (Al-Bukhari) </b></q></li>
			<li>Abu Hurayrah reported that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said<q><b>Fasting is a shield; so when one of you is fasting he should neither indulge in obscene language nor should he raise his voice in anger. If someone attacks him or insults him, let him say:<mark> “I am fasting!”</mark> (Muslim) </b></q></li>
